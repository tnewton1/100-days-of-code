# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 9 "Classes" pages 171, 172, and exercise 9-6.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the exercise, but I've learned that building up a code library helps. I was able to re-use exercise 9-4 as a base and to add the additional class and attributes. I also had to reach back and use a loop and a list. I haven't used these lately.

### Day 1: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Chapter 9 "Classes", excercise 9-7.

**Thoughts:** I'm wondering if this will get easier. I found myself having to reference back a little bit and struggled a bit to get some of my code to work. Eventually, though, I did have a moment where it hit me on what I needed to do and then I got it working.
