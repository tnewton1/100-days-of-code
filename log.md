# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 9 "Classes" pages 171, 172, and exercise 9-6.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the exercise, but I've learned that building up a code library helps. I was able to re-use exercise 9-4 as a base and to add the additional class and attributes. I also had to reach back and use a loop and a list. I haven't used these lately.
