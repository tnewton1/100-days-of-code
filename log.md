# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chapter 9 "Classes" pages 171, 172, and exercise 9-6.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the exercise, but I've learned that building up a code library helps. I was able to re-use exercise 9-4 as a base and to add the additional class and attributes. I also had to reach back and use a loop and a list. I haven't used these lately.

### Day 1: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Chapter 9 "Classes", excercise 9-7.

**Thoughts:** I'm wondering if this will get easier. I found myself having to reference back a little bit and struggled a bit to get some of my code to work. Eventually, though, I did have a moment where it hit me on what I needed to do and then I got it working.

### Day 2: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Chapter 9 "Classes", excercise 9-8.

**Thoughts:** This was a particularly hard challenge for me. I had to look a few things up in order to get it to work. Turns out, I really messed it up. I guess I was extra tired which didn't help. While Exercise 9-7 is _kind of_ correct, it actually isn't. I should have created an empty list for permissions. For example, this is just wrong:

```
class Admin(User):
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name)
        self.privileges = ['can add post', 'can delete post', 'can ban user', 'can edit post', 'can delete user', 'can change username']

    def show_privileges(self):
        print("Assigned privileges: ")
        for privileges in self.privileges:
            print(f"\nÂ· {privileges.title()}")
```

It should be:

```
class Admin(User):
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name)
        self.privileges = []

    def show_privileges(self):
        print("Assigned privileges: ")
        for privileges in self.privileges:
            print(f"\nÂ· {privileges.title()}")
```

And then you would define the privileges by creating a list later on. Oh well. Lesson learned!

### Day 3: May 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Chapter 9. Completed exercise 9-9, and part of Importing Classes, pages 174-176.

**Thoughts:** I am noticing I am starting to notice the patterns in the code and where I can reuse stuff. I did not find exercise 9-9 too challenging. It was pretty easy to figure out. Importing classes is a great topic to be on as I find it particularly helpful to be organized in code and this helps me out. I was noticing that some of these files were getting long and a bit chaotic. Breaking them up helps!

### Day 4: May 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Simple day. Worked on importing multiple classes, page 177

**Thoughts:** I took an easy day today. I'm promising myself to do more tomorrow. This was just importing multiple classes. It was fairly simple and not too hard.

### Day 5: May 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Another simple day. Pages 177-180, exercises 9-10 and 9-11.

**Thoughts:** It was another easy day. Just working on some simple exercises and redoing some exercises with new skills.

### Day 6: June 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercise 9-13 after reading through page 180.

**Thoughts:** I burned most of my time trying to figure out some error messages. I kept getting the following:

```
travis@Traviss-MBP-M1 python-crash-course % /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3 /Users/travis/repos/python-crash-course/dice.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/travis/repos/python-crash-course/dice.py", line 19, in <module>
    result = die1.roll_die()
  File "/Users/travis/repos/python-crash-course/dice.py", line 10, in roll_die
    return randint(1, self.sides)
AttributeError: 'Die' object has no attribute 'sides'
```

I kept going through my code. I even looked up the solution and adjusted my code to match (I was actually extremely close! I am proud of myself for that!) and I was still getting `AttributeError: 'Die' object has no attribute 'sides'`. Yes. It. Does. 

After rage searching, I came across this [one reddit post on /r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/adcqw8/need_help_with_classes_getting_an_attributeerror/) by /u/2313499. It was the exact same (well, different attribute name) as mine. Then I see their comment:

> Holy crap.. I just figured it out. I was using 3X_ for my init method instead of 2x_. or ___init___(3=bad) vs __init__(2 = good).

I review my code. Sure enough, I had `__init___(self, sides=6)` instead of `__init__(self, sides=6)`. Three underscores at the end. VSCode must have carried in my initial underscore when I used autocomplete. I'm looking at using Atom or Sublime again. This isn't my first issue with VSCode. I've never had any issues with Sublime - and I even used Sublime to work in C.

Anyways, today was a really short day and I didn't get much done because I spent most of the time troubleshooting a stupid error. ðŸ¥±

### Day 7: June 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercise 9-14

**Thoughts:** This excercise I wasn't able to complete. I think I have an issue in my `while` loop. When I tried executing the script, it never completed. I watched my CPU usage go up (but yay, M1 MBP! Still didn't hear the fan!) but nothing happened. I had to kill the process. Started debugging to try and figure out what the issue is but I'm out of time for today. ðŸ˜ž
